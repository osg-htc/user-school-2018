Tuesday Exercise 1.1: Refresher – Submitting Multiple Jobs
==========================================================

The goal of this exercise is to map the physical locations of some worker nodes in our local cluster. To do this, you will write a simple submit file that will queue multiple jobs and then manually collate the results.

Where in the world are my jobs?
-------------------------------

To find the physical location of the computers your jobs our running on, you will use a method called *geolocation*. Geolocation uses a registry to match a computer’s network address to an approximate latitude and longitude.

### Geolocation code

Below is a Python script that geolocates the machine that it is running on, returning [latitude and longitude coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system). It is not important to understand how the internals of the script works.

``` file
#!/bin/env python

import sys
import socket
import urllib2
import json
import time

hostnames = set()
if len(sys.argv) == 1:
    hostnames.add(socket.getfqdn())
else:
    for filename in sys.argv[1:]:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                hostnames.update(set([x.strip() for x in f.readlines()]))
        except IOError:
            pass

hostnames.discard('')
for host in hostnames:
    try:
        ipaddr = socket.gethostbyname(host)
        for i in range(1,4):
            try:
                response = urllib2.urlopen('http://www.freegeoip.net/json/' + ipaddr).read()
                json_response = json.loads(response)
                lat = json_response['latitude']
                lon = json_response['longitude']

                if int(lat) is 0 and int(lon) is 0:
                    exit("www.freegeoip.net could not find associated lat/lon coordinates.")
                print "%s,%s" % (lat, lon)
                break
            except urllib2.HTTPError:
                time.sleep(3**i)
                pass
    except socket.gaierror:
        pass
```

When called without any arguments, the above script will return the latitude and longitude coordinates of the machine that it is run on.

### Geolocating several machines

Now, let’s try to use this Python script and remember some basic HTCondor ideas from yesterday!

1.  Log on to `learn.chtc.wisc.edu`
2.  Create and change into a new folder for this exercise, for example `tuesday-1.1`
3.  Save the Python script above as a file named `location.py`
4.  As always, ensure that your script has the proper permissions (hint: try running it from the command line)
5.  Create a submit file that generates ten jobs that run `location.py` and uses the `$(Process)` macro to write different `output` and `error` files. Try to do this step without looking at materials from yesterday. But if you are stuck, see [yesterday’s exercise 2.4](../day1/part2-ex4-queue-n.md).
6.  Submit your jobs and wait for the results

### Collating your results

Now that you have your results, it's time to summarize them. Rather than inspecting each output file individually, you can use the `cat` command to print the results from all of your output files at once. If all of your output files have the format `location-#.out` (e.g., `location-10.out`), your command will look something like this:

``` console
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>cat location-*.out</strong>
```

The `*` is a wildcard so the above cat command runs on all files that start with `location-` and end in `.out`. Additionally, you can use `cat` in tandem with the `sort` and `uniq` commands to print only the unique results:

``` console
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>cat location-*.out | sort | uniq</strong>
```

Mapping your results
--------------------

To visualize the locations of the machines that your jobs ran on, you will be using <http://www.mapcustomizer.com/>. Copy and paste the collated results into the text box that pops up when clicking on the 'Bulk Entry' button on the right-hand side. Are the results what you expected?
